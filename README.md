# LibTextFormat
Library for Elder Scrolls Online Addons - Advanced Text Formatting and Parsing

## Development Status: alpha  
(unstable, use at your own risk)

## Description
This library is to add advanced text parsing and formatting, suitable for use in any precanned communication.

It allows addons to refer to variables in text, such as "{house}" which will output a formatted house link.

It also enables addons to create "protocols" in which you can encode an object into text, then decode it later to get the object back.
